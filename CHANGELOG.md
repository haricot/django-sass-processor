- 0.7

- 0.5.7

* Fixed: Catch exception if s3boto is not installed.

- 0.5.6

* Added compatibility layer to work with AWS S3 Storage.

- 0.5.5

* Create directory `SASS_PROCESSOR_ROOT` if it does not exist.

- 0.5.4

* Added unit tests and continuous integration to the project.

- 0.5.3

* Fixed compilescss: Did not find calls of sass_processor within a dict, list or tuple

- 0.5.2

* Fixed Python 3 incompatibility. Open files as binaries, since they may contain unicode characters.

- 0.5.1

* Add `APPS_INCLUDE_DIRS` to the SASS include path.

- 0.5.0

* SASS/SCSS files can also be referenced in pure Python files, for instance in `Media` class or
  `media` property definitions.
* The SASS processor will look for potential include directories, so that the `@import "..."`
  statement also works for SASS files located in other Django apps.

- 0.4.0 - 0.4.4

* Refactored the sass processor into a self-contained class `SassProcessor`, which can be accessed
  through an API, the Jinja2 template engine and the existing templatetag.

- 0.3.5

* Added Jinja2 support, see [Jinja2 support](#jinja2-support).

- 0.3.4

* Fixed: `get_template_sources()` in Django-1.9 returns Objects rather than strings.
* In command, use `ArgumentParser` rather than `OptionParser`.

- 0.3.1...0.3.3

* Changed the build process in `setup.py`.

- 0.3.0

* Compatible with Django 1.8+.
* bootstrap3-sass ready: appropriate floating point precision (8) can be set in `settings.py`.
* Offline compilation results may optionally be stored in `SASS_PROCESSOR_ROOT`.

- 0.2.6

* Hotfix: added SASS function `get-setting` also to offline compiler.

- 0.2.5

* Compatible with Python3
* Replaced `SortedDict` with `OrderedDict` to be prepared for Django-1.9
* Raise a `TemplateSyntax` error, if a SASS `@include "..."` fails to find the file.
* Added SASS function `get-setting` to fetch configuration directives from `settings.py`.

- 0.2.4

* Forcing compiled unicode to bytes, since 'Font Awesome' uses Unicode Private Use Area (PUA)
  and hence implicit conversion on `fh.write()` failed.

- 0.2.3

* Allow for setting template extensions and output style.
* Force Django to calculate template_source_loaders from TEMPLATE_LOADERS settings, by asking to find a dummy template.

- 0.2.0

* Removed dependency to **django-sekizai** and **django-classy-tags**. It now can operate in
  stand-alone mode. Therefore the project has been renamed to **django-sass-processor**.

- 0.1.0

* Initial revision named **django-sekizai-processors**, based on a preprocessor for the Sekizai
  template tags `{% addtoblock %}`.
